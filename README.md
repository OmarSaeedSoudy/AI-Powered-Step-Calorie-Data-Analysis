📌p Project Title: AI-Powered Step & Calorie Data Analysis

A statistical and machine learning approach to understanding step count and calorie burn patterns.

📚 Overview

This project applies statistical methods and machine learning to analyze step count, calorie burn, and walking distance. The goal is to explore trends, correlations, and classifications to provide insights into walking habits.

🚀 Features

📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Step count trends over time

Steps vs. calorie burn correlation

Outlier detection & anomaly analysis

🤖 Machine Learning Models

Linear Regression: Predict calorie burn from step count

K-Means Clustering: Group users based on walking patterns

Hypothesis Testing: Validate if more steps lead to more calories burned

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): Classify activity levels

📈 Visualizations & Reports

Line charts, scatter plots, heatmaps

Summary statistics & insights

📈 Results & Insights

Higher step counts correlate with more calories burned.

Three walking behavior clusters were identified (Low, Medium, High activity).

Statistical tests confirm that walking more significantly impacts calorie burn.

ML models effectively classify activity levels.
